/**
 * Encodes a subset of a piece of geometry (i.e. a UsdGeomImageable) 
 * as a set of indices. Currently supports encoding subsets of faces, 
 * points, edges, segments, and tetrahedrons.
 *
 * To apply to a geometric prim, a GeomSubset prim must be the prim's direct 
 * child in namespace, and possess a concrete defining specifier (i.e. def). 
 * This restriction makes it easy and efficient to discover subsets of a prim. 
 * We might want to relax this restriction if it's common to have multiple 
 * <b>families</b> of subsets on a gprim and if it's useful to be able to 
 * organize subsets belonging to a <b>family</b> under a common scope. See 
 * 'familyName' attribute for more info on defining a family of subsets.
